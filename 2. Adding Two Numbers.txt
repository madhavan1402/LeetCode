Adding Two Numbers:

The "Add Two Numbers" problem is a common coding challenge that involves adding two numbers represented as linked lists. Each node in the linked list represents a single digit, and the digits are stored in reverse order. In this post, we'll explore a solution using C++.
Cpp:

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode* dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* current = dummyHead;
        int carry = 0;

        while (l1 != nullptr || l2 != nullptr) {
            int x = (l1 != nullptr) ? l1->val : 0;
            int y = (l2 != nullptr) ? l2->val : 0;

            int sum = x + y + carry;
            carry = sum / 10;

            current->next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
            current = current->next;

            if (l1 != nullptr) l1 = l1->next;
            if (l2 != nullptr) l2 = l2->next;
        }

        if (carry > 0) {
            current->next = new ListNode(carry);
        }

        return dummyHead->next;
    }
};

Explanation of the Code:

      1.Initialization: We start by creating a dummy head node to simplify the handling of the result linked list. A pointer current is used to track the current position in the 
        result list, and a carry variable is initialized to zero.
      2.While Loop: The loop continues until both linked lists are fully traversed. Inside the loop:
            o Extract values from l1 and l2, defaulting to zero if a list has been fully traversed.
            o Calculate the sum of the two values plus any carry from the previous operation.
            o Update the carry for the next iteration and create a new node with the digit to store in the result list.
      3.Final Carry Check: After the loop, if there's any carry left, a new node is added to the result list.
      4.Return the Result: The function returns the next node of the dummy head, which points to the actual result.

This solution efficiently adds two numbers represented by linked lists in O(max(m, n)) time complexity, where m and n are the lengths of the input lists. It's a great example of handling data structures in a real-world problem.
